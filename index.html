        <p><h1>Future Programmer Zone Community was created to help programmers reach their dreams by connecting with people who have the same interests and hobbies.</h1></p>
        <p>The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct.</p>
        <p>In some ways, programming is like painting. You start with a blank canvas and certain basic raw materials. You use a combination of science, art, and craft to determine what to do with them.</p>
